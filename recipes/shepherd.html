        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Shepherd's pie is a comfort food casserole that originated in England. It's traditionally made with minced meat (usually ground lamb), gravy, vegetables, and mashed potatoes.
            You may also hear it called "cottage pie." The two terms are used interchangeably, but technically traditional shepherd's pie is made with ground lamb and traditional cottage pie is made with ground beef.
